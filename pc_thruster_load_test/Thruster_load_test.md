## Serial Interface with arduino

- Using libserial found [here](https://github.com/crayzeewulf/libserial.git). I need to install it from git
- And there is an issue with installing it. I think I can just use the source files directly. Link and make a library and use them directly. The lib installation actually abstracts it away and makes it less portable. Let me try to have it all together.
